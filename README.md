# get_smart

Let's say you are on the train, wondering about some stuff, what did this person do, what happened there, why is something like it is, how does something work? 
You look it up on your smartphone, you are happy to feel a little bit smarter...and a day later you have already forgotten again.
This app has the easy task to remember stuff, boost your general knowledge and maybe make you all little bit smarter. You can create own articles, with stuff you just looked up
and also save your sources.
